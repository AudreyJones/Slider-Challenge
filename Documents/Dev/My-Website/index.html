            <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I took a roundabout path towards software development, discovering it in my freshman year of college, but pursuing an undergraduate degree in Neuroscience, thinking I would apply to medical school after undergrad. Through two undergrad research positions, I realized that medicine was not the field I was looking for. After graduating, I took a step back and remembered how challenging and interesting I had found coding as a freshman. So, I sought out Meetup groups based around women in code and stumbled upon the group, Girl Develop It (GDI) in late 2016. In 2017, I started attending GDI events, panels, and classes in HTML, CSS, JS, and UX/UI research.

                There, I learned of coding bootcamps, did my research, applied, and got into the Flatiron School's online fullstack engineering program.
            
                In my free time I weave (crochet and chain maille), drink way too much cold brew, watch true crime shows, and do aqua fit.
