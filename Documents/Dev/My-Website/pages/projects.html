                        <p>In my free time I do yoga, search for the perfect latte, browse Zillow and Hotpads (verging on obession), and listen to podcasts like Reply All (broadly about the internet) and Chatty Broads (for the Bachelor/Bachelorette recaps, which is a major guilty pleasure). In my not quite so free time, I enjoy cooking inspired by the New York Times cooking app (though it inevitably takes me 2 hours more than the recipe predicts), walking all around Philly, and cleaning the yoga studio as a trade for a discounted membership.
            
                        My career interests are focused around user experience and front-end web development where I can draw upon my experience in technology, human behavior, and design to create seamless and intuitive user interfaces. </p>
